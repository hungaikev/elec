## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Data Description

The analysis is based on measurements of electric power consumption in one household, collected over a period of 47 months from December 2006 to November 2010. The data was recorded at one-minute intervals, resulting in a total of 2,075,259 measurements. The dataset includes the following variables:

1. Date and time of measurement
2. Global active power (household global minute-averaged active power in kilowatt)
3. Global reactive power (household global minute-averaged reactive power in kilowatt)
4. Voltage (minute-averaged voltage in volt)
5. Global intensity (household global minute-averaged current intensity in ampere)
6. Sub-metering 1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy), corresponding to the kitchen
7. Sub-metering 2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy), corresponding to the laundry room
8. Sub-metering 3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy), corresponding to an electric water heater and an air-conditioner

It's worth noting that sub-meterings 1, 2, and 3 do not account for all the energy consumption. The remaining energy consumption (global active power - sub-metering 1 - sub-metering 2 - sub-metering 3) corresponds to other appliances in the house.
